# Fills in missing vertex groups for a model so there are no gaps, and sorts to make sure everything is in order
# Works on the currently selected object
# e.g. if the selected model has groups 0 1 4 5 7 2 it adds an empty group for 3 and 6 and sorts to make it 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
# Very useful to make sure there are no gaps or out-of-order vertex groups
