# Combines vertex groups with the same prefix into one, a fast alternative to the Vertex Weight Mix that works for multiple groups
# You will likely want to use blender_fill_vg_gaps.txt after this to fill in any gaps caused by merging groups together

selected_obj = [obj for obj in bpy.context.selected_objects]


##### USAGE INSTRUCTIONS. UNCOMMENT THE LINE FOR THE CASE YOU WANT TO USE


# CASE 1: Runs the merge on a specific list of vertex groups in the selected object(s). Can add more names or fewer to the list - change the names to what you need
# vgroup_names = [["replace with first vertex group name", "second vertex group name", "third name, etc."]]


# CASE 2: Runs the merge on a range of vertex groups in the selected object(s). Replace smallest_group with the lower bound, and largest group with the upper bound ("range" in python does not include the upper bound by default, so need to add 1)
# vgroup_names = [[f"{i}" for i in range(smallest_group_number, largest_group_number+1)]]


# CASE 3: Runs the merge on ALL vertex groups in the selected object(s)
# vgroup_names = [[x.name.split(".")[0] for x in y.vertex_groups] for y in selected_obj]
